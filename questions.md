<h2>3. Write 2-3 sentences about how the use of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS creates the final product.</h2>
<p>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can all be used to make one coherent project that looks nice and is functional. HTML can be used for the layout of the project while CSS can be used for the colors and styling of the page, these two work together to make a page look nice.
